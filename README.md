# Domain Randomization
Reinforcement learning policies trained only in simulation are likely to face a performance drop when transferred to the physical world due to the approximations made by simulated environments. This phenomenon is known as the _sim-to-real_ gap. 

Domain randomization is a _sim-to-real_ technique to mitigate the gap between simulation and reality, which randomizes the simulation parameters every training episode so that the policy experiences a variety of simulation scenarios.
